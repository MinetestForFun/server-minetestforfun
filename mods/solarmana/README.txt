Description
-----------

This is a mod for MineTest. It depends on, and modifies / works
with the Mana mod 'mana' by Wuzzy. Instead of constantly
regenerating mana, this mod requires players to stand in direct
sunlight for regeneration to kick in.

Since many magic users prefer their homes and offices to actually
have a roof, standing on specific node types (currently wooden
planks and gold blocks) will also regenerate mana.

Now with support for slower, and negative, regeneration. Just
for fun, standing on stone will drain your mana...
